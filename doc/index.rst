Welcome to pdf2xlsx's documentation!
====================================

A framework to open a zip file which contains multiple pdf files
representing invoices. The invoices are parsed into Invoice and Entry (invoice
entries) classes. These are converted to XLSX format.

There is a gui supporting the initialization of the conversion, and a logger to
show detailes about the process.
